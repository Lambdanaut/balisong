# NOTES

2. Preload login interface
3. Display login interface
4. Accept login credentials
5. Download account settings
6. Apply account settings
7. Download map meta-data
8. Preload map graphics

## Ingame Server-Client back-and-forth

1. Map is fully loaded
2. Player presses the <- arrow key
3. Client begins moving character to the left
4. Client tells server that the player is moving to the left
5. Server tells all clients in the room that player is moving to the left
6. Client releases <- arrow key
7. Client stops moving character to the left
8. Server tells all clients in the room that player is no longer moving to the left
9. Server ALSO tells all clients the player's new position

The same process occurs if a player hits a barrier, rather than releasing the <- arrow key.
